It served me pretty well - a basic crud for expenses. A year on, <a id="more"></a>I decided to take a look at what I’ve done and do some much needed maintenance.</p>
<h2 id="In-Summary"><a href="#In-Summary" class="headerlink" title="In Summary"></a>In Summary</h2><p>In summary, I had:</p>
<ul>
<li>overhauled the UI twice (sigh)</li>
<li>cleaned up the code (horror me at myself)</li>
<li>upgraded packages etc</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a fruitful maintenance! Felt alot of horror at my first foray into React and Firebase, one year on, I hoped I had matured and gotten more experience. The end result was quite satisfactory.</p>

<h3 id="Cleaning-Code"><a href="#Cleaning-Code" class="headerlink" title="Cleaning Code"></a>Cleaning Code</h3><p>First thing I did was to clean up code. I was passing in my UID into every child component, which I found rather unclean to look at - hence I installed the redux packages. </p>
<ul>
<li>Yay to no more passing of props down this long rabbit hole</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Nay to using redux only for one purpose lol</li>
</ul>
<p>I also cleaned up some code, rewrote some lines, made it look neat. </p>
<h3 id="Overhauling-UI"><a href="#Overhauling-UI" class="headerlink" title="Overhauling UI"></a>Overhauling UI</h3><img src="/2019/08/23/2019-8-Revisiting-Expense-Tracker/ui-old.png" class="" title="demo image">
<p>LHS was old app design, RHS was first iteration of the new UI. I overhauled the UI also because I wanted to try a new UI framework - <a href="https://ant.design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antd</a>. It has tons of components and the clean and simple application of their usage had impressed me greatly! Totally would recommend.</p>
<h4 id="User-Interface"><a href="#User-Interface" class="headerlink" title="User Interface"></a>User Interface</h4><p>I had simplified and made the UI much cleaner. Last time, flat colors were a big thing and I wanted a splash of alot of color. This time round, taking reference from other apps like Grab, Google, Carousell who were going with a light background, I also decided to let white be the dominant color of the app with a touch of secondary colors in icons and bars. </p>
<h4 id="Navigation"><a href="#Navigation" class="headerlink" title="Navigation"></a>Navigation</h4><p>The original UI designed for web, so this time round, I tried to design it with a mobile first mindset. I created my own menu / shortcut in the dashboard instead of having a tabbed bar at the bottom like regular navigation in native apps. </p>
<h4 id="Organization"><a href="#Organization" class="headerlink" title="Organization"></a>Organization</h4><p>Previously, I used to prize efficiency and add expense at the same page as the expense list. In the end, it didn’t really work out as I felt that the Creating and Viewing functions in one screen didn’t give a very consistent look - so I decided to separate them and add nav links to them. I also placed creating expense as a shortcut on the nav bar on the dashboard. </p>
<h3 id="Re-evaluating-the-Focus"><a href="#Re-evaluating-the-Focus" class="headerlink" title="Re-evaluating the Focus"></a>Re-evaluating the Focus</h3><p>In the past, I didn’t have a dashboard page - it was an empty home page. This time, I had to think about what were the important things that I wanted to focus on. What was the core purpose that I wanted to achieve when I wanted to build this? I came up with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keeping track of expenses on a daily basis</li>
<li>as well as comparing it to previous months</li>
</ul>
<p>That is why the dashboard clearly shows the past expenses in the past 6 months and provides also shortcuts to add/view expenses. I decided to do away with showing of income/investment as that was a good to have but not really priority. Deciding that the focus was on expenses, it helped to shape the look and focus of the app. </p>
<h3 id="New-Function"><a href="#New-Function" class="headerlink" title="New Function"></a>New Function</h3><p>I only added a new screen - profile screen for inputing recurring income and investment expenses. I also added budget there so that you can track how much of your budget you have used.</p>
<h2 id="Summing-up-amp-Takeaways"><a href="#Summing-up-amp-Takeaways" class="headerlink" title="Summing up &amp; Takeaways"></a>Summing up &amp; Takeaways</h2><p>So, in conclusion, I am pretty happy with the new design. Maybe I’ll feel differently one year from now haha. </p>
<p>Some takeaways I felt were important:</p>
<ul>
<li>I should do some mockups before proceeding, else I’ll just need to overhaul more things</li>
<li>Taking a step back, to understand from a macro point of view, what was important and priority for an app</li>
</ul>
